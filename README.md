# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) V2.0

## 📋 Overview
A sophisticated Network Intrusion Detection System that leverages machine learning to detect and prevent network intrusions in real-time. The system analyzes network traffic patterns and identifies potential security threats using advanced algorithms.

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 Machine learning-based intrusion detection
- 📊 Interactive dashboard for monitoring
- 🚨 Real-time alerts for suspicious activities
- 📈 Historical data analysis and reporting
- 🔐 Secure user authentication and authorization

## 🏗️ Architecture
The system is built using a modern tech stack:
- **Frontend**: Vite React.js with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Express with MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security
